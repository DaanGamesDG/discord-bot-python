# Discord bot written in Python

Hi, welcome to this useless repo. I decided to make this one public so people can evaluate my code and give feedback. I am currently learning Python so expect my code to be spaghetti code.
Since this is a useless repo, you can do with it whatever you want, I only want some credits and you can use it in your projects if you like.

Without further ado, welcome to my `spaghetti code` world!
